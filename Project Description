Project Title: 
Local Database Access Using H2 for Offline Development.

Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a lightweight application that uses the H2 database 
to provide local access to data without the need for connection to a production or remote database. 
This approach allows developers to simulate interactions with a database in a local environment, 
making it ideal for development, testing, and proof-of-concept stages without incurring the 
overhead of setting up or accessing a live database.

Key Features:

1. H2 Database Integration:
The application will use the H2 database in-memory mode, allowing local access to a relational database without needing a remote or production database. 
It will support a variety of SQL operations in a lightweight, fast, and embedded environment.

2. CRUD Functionality:
The application will provide Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations, allowing full interaction with the local H2 database. 
This will simulate typical interactions with a relational database.

3. Schema Initialization:
On startup, the application will automatically create and initialize the H2 database with a predefined schema, allowing users to start using the database right away.
For DB Structure creation: schema.sql
For Data insertion: data.sql

4. In-Memory Mode:
The application will support in-memory mode where data is cleared after the session ends.

Technical Stack:
Backend: Java and Spring Boot
Database: H2 Database (in-memory DB)
Build Tool: Maven
Postman: To test and ensure that APIs are working as expected.

This application is aimed at developers who need to simulate database interactions in a local environment, primarily for development and testing purposes.
